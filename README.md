Case Study : Project Booki

The outline :
I work as a junior front-end at Booki, a small business that offers a platform to book accomodations for the holidays ! This website will allow the future users to find accomodations and activities according to the chosen cities. The accomodations can be booked through filters ranged by themes, for example this could be done through a "budget" filter or a "romantic" filter. The models given to me are based on the principles of Material Design which were designed by Loic, the UI designer for this project.

Objectives :
Implementing a responsive interface
Integrate the content conforming to the given visual models
