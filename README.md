Case Study : Project Booki

The outline :
Assuming that this is my first traning as a junior front-end at Booki, a small business that offers a platform to book accomodations for the holidays ! this website will allow o the futur users to find accomodations and activities according to the chosen cities. The accomodations can be booked through filters ranged by themes, for example this could be done through a "budget" filter or a "romantic" atmosphere one. The models given to us are based on the principles of Material Design which were designed by Loic, the UI designer on this project.

Objectives :
Implementing a responsive interface
Integrate the content conforming to the visual models
